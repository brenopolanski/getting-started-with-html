  <b>Introduction to HTML</b>
  <p>
    Most fundamentally, when you look at a webpage in a
    <a title="Web browser: A Web browser is a program that retrieves and displays pages from the Web, and lets users access further pages through hyperlinks." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser">Web browser</a>,
    you see words. But most of the time webpages contain <em>styled</em>
    text rather than <em>plain text</em>. Nowadays, webpage designers have
    access to hundreds of different fonts, font sizes, colors, and even
    alphabets (e.g. Spanish, Japanese, Russian), and browsers can, for
    the most part, display them accurately. Webpages may also contain images,
    video clips, and background music. They may include drop-down menus,
    search boxes, or links you can follow to access other pages (whether on
    the same site or another site). Some websites even let visitors customize
    the page display to accommodate their preferences and challenges (e.g.,
    sight challenges, deafness, or color blindness). Often a page contains
    content boxes that move (scroll) while the rest of the page remains static.

  <b>History of HTML</b>
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, then a
    contractor at <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</a> (the European
    Organization for Nuclear Research), devised a way in the late 1980s for scientists
    to share documents over the <a title="Internet: The Internet is a worldwide network of networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (also named TCP/IP from its two most important protocols)." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Internet">Internet</a>.
    Before that, Internet communication had been limited to plain text, using
    technologies such as email, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ftp">FTP</a> (File Transfer Protocol),
    and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a>-based discussion boards.

  <b>What is HTML?</b>
  <p>
    <a title="HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a>
    is a <strong>markup language</strong>. The word <em>markup</em> was used by editors who
    <em>marked up</em> manuscripts (usually with a blue pencil) when giving instructions for revisions.
    "Markup" now means something slightly different: a language with specific syntax that instructs a Web
    browser how to display a page. Once again, HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so on)
    from "presentation" (instructions for displaying each type of content). HTML uses a pre-defined set of
    <a title="elements: An element is a part of a webpage. In XML and HTML, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag:" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>
    to define content types. Elements contain one or more "<a title="tags: In HTML a tag is used for creating an element. The name of an HTML element is the name used in angle brackets such as <p> for paragraph. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, &quot;</p>&quot;, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag">tags</a>"
    that contain or express content. Tags are enclosed by angle brackets, and the closing tag begins with a forward slash.
